# PairSum-BruteForceCheck-ARRAYLIST
Java implementation of a brute-force approach to check if any two elements in an array list sum up to a given target. Uses nested loops to explore all unique pairs. Time Complexity: O(n²) — ideal for understanding pair-checking logic before moving to hashing or two-pointer optimizations.
